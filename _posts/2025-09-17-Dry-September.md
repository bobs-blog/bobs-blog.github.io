**William Faulkner** (1897–1962) stands as one of the most uncompromising voices in American literature. Writing primarily about the American South, Faulkner exposed the moral rot beneath its traditions—race, violence, memory, guilt, and inherited cruelty recur obsessively throughout his work. His fictional Yoknapatawpha County became a microcosm of the South itself, a place where history never stays buried and private sins spill into public life.

Faulkner’s prose is often dense, elliptical, and psychologically charged. He was less interested in neat narratives than in the inner weather of his characters—their fears, denials, justifications, and moments of moral collapse. In stories like _Dry September_, Faulkner strips away romantic notions of honor and justice to reveal how easily a community can surrender to prejudice and collective violence. His work does not offer comfort or redemption; instead, it demands confrontation with the ugliest parts of human nature and asks the reader to bear witness.

this one is brutal, honestly. _Dry September_ is a short story that wastes no time showing how racism and mob mentality feed off each other, especially in a small Southern town where rumor travels faster than truth. everything starts with a whisper — an accusation against a Black man — and that’s all it takes. no proof, no real questioning, just fear, prejudice, and the need to act before anyone thinks too hard.

> “The barber went on shaving. He did not look at the man he was shaving.”


faulkner doesn’t focus on the event itself as much as the atmosphere around it. the heat, the dryness, the tension — everything feels suffocating. it’s like the town itself is holding its breath, ready to explode. what’s terrifying is how ordinary it all feels. these aren’t cartoon villains; they’re regular people, convincing themselves they’re doing the right thing while slipping deeper into violence.

what really stuck with me is how quickly fairness disappears. once the mob forms, logic and justice don’t matter anymore. the truth becomes irrelevant. faulkner shows how easily people surrender their moral responsibility when they feel backed by the crowd. no one wants to be the one to stop it — and that silence becomes its own kind of cruelty.

> “It was not a matter of fact now, but of belief.”

> “He believed that he had done the right thing.”

it’s not an easy read. it’s uncomfortable, angry, and unsettling on purpose. but that’s exactly why it works. _Dry September_ forces you to sit with ugly truths about prejudice, fear, and how society protects itself at the expense of the innocent. and what makes it even harder to shake is how relevant it still feels — how little has really changed when rumors, race, and collective fear collide.

short, sharp, and devastating. faulkner didn’t write this to comfort anyone.

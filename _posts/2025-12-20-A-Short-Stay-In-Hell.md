**Steven L. Peck** is an evolutionary biologist, professor at Brigham Young University, and an award-winning author of speculative fiction. His unique position at the intersection of rigorous science and deep Mormon faith informs his writing, which often explores complex systems—theological, ecological, and metaphysical—with intellectual fearlessness and dark humor. His work has earned critical acclaim, including the **Association for Mormon Letters Novel Award** for _The Scholar of Moab_.
In _A Short Stay in Hell_, his most celebrated work, Peck deploys his signature blend of clear, accessible prose and mind-bending conceptual scale. The novella is less a traditional narrative than a precise, devastating thought experiment, demonstrating his ability to transform philosophical inquiry into gripping, existential horror.

**I’m afraid to admit that I was a bit disappointed…**

This novella was extremely hyped up for me and I think I was expecting something much more than what I got. Even tho finished it in one sitting.

It’s a brief, gleefully bleak horror comedy that begins with three pretty funny jokes. Our Mormon protagonist finds himself in a room being administered by an 8 foot demon complete with horns. Demon is trying to figure out which hell he should go to.  
_What? But I shouldn’t be here at all! I’m a good Mormon! I believe in God and Jesus and everything!_  
Demon explains well, kiddo, you picked the wrong religion. The real true religion is Zoroastrianism. Our Mormon is indignant – why was this not made clear? “Bit of bad luck there,” says the demon, in a _don’t blame me, I don’t make the rules_ kind of way.

## **What is Zoroastrianism?** 

The short of it is this: Ahura Mazda is the supreme God. He created everything. Evil entered the world. Man has free will. There is no savior, no redeemer, so your works either save you or they don’t. There is a Hell, but in the end you get into Heaven. Zoroaster wrote the Aveda, their sacred scriptures, drawn from multiple visions during which Ahura Mazda answered his many questions. Are there similarities to other religions? Yes. Does that mean anything? Maybe. Does Peck actually believe this? Who knows.

So he gets zapped off to one particular Hell and he’s reading the rules on a big helpful board:  
**_Welcome to Hell. This Hell is based upon a short story by Jorge Luis Borges from your world called “The Library of Babel”. Here you will find all the books that can possibly be written._**

In case you were wondering how many books are in this library of hell, there is an answer. The combination of letters and words are confined to those found on a Roman alphabet keyboard, and include all the punctuation too, alas, so the number is quite high, it’s 95 to the power of 1,312,000 which is way way more than the number of electrons in our present universe.

## **Is there suffering in Peck’s Hell?** 

**Oh yes. But it is not what you think.**  
This hell is filled with all white people. All Americans from 1939 to 2043. No blacks. No Asians. No diversity.  
Historically, Mormonism did have racist doctrines—claims about Black people and divine favor—that were taught and enforced for generations. The modern LDS Church officially disavows those ideas, but Peck is not pretending that history didn’t exist. He’s a Mormon biologist who thinks in systems and failures, not a missionary writing propaganda.
## **And this is where it lost me.** 

The setup is perfect. The logic is airtight. The math is horrifying. But after all that, the book just… plays out the idea. It feels like watching a brilliant philosophy proof get acted out by characters who know they’re in a thought experiment.

I wanted to _feel_ the library. I wanted the weight of those years to press down on the page. Instead, it just moved on to the next event, the next civilization, the next million years. The terror was in the _concept_, not in my bones.

It’s a hell designed by a biologist who understands systems better than despair. The architecture is flawless. I just never felt trapped inside it.
